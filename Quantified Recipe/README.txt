Running this code will require a web server.
The *.js files in the current directory are the
code that manages the server while everything in
the public folder is the web pages themselves.
Just drag everything as is into your web server and
node index.js to start up the server. The port number
this is listening in to is 20047.
Please refer to the sample images if you don't want to 
run it yourself.

I wrote most of the code myself, but some of the code
like parts of the server were provided to me by the
89H class at UC Davis.
